## How to Import Content from Another Book

If you're working on a project and want to reuse or repurpose material from another book—whether it's your own work or an openly licensed resource—Pressbooks offers tools to help you import that content seamlessly. This feature is especially useful for educators, authors, and institutions building upon existing open educational resources (OER).

1. Open the book you want to import content from, and click "Organize" in the left-hand menu.
2. On the right-hand side, click the "Text (HTML)" tab to view the editable content.
   !['Text(HTML)' menu is highlighted](/pressbooks-getting-started-student/import_content_1.png)

   !['Save' button is highlighted](/pressbooks-getting-started-student/import_content_3.png)

## Book Structure in Pressbooks: Parts and Chapters

A book written in **Pressbooks** is made up of chapters which are grouped and ordered into parts. Chapters are web pages or building blocks within which content is added. Parts are overarching sections that hold chapters ([Pressbooks Guide from eCampusOntario](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/pressbooks/)).

![Chapters placed directly under the Main Body should be avoided and marked with a red cross to indicate incorrect structure.](/pressbooks-getting-started-student/create_chapter_dont.png)

If you plan on using Parts to organize your book, don't create all the chapters under the Main Body. Instead, create a separate part and then click the "Add Chapter" button next to it to organize your content properly. The overall structure of the book should follow this format:

!['Add Chapter' and 'Add Part' button are highlighted](/pressbooks-getting-started-student/create_part.png)

- Part 1
  - Chapter 1.1
  - Chapter 1.2
  - Chapter 1.3
- Part 2
  - Chapter 2.1
  - Chapter 2.2
  - Chapter 2.3

## Add Users to Your Book

Adding users to your book is a powerful way to collaborate and enhance your project. By inviting co-authors, editors, or contributors, you can streamline the content creation process and bring diverse perspectives to your work. **Pressbooks** offers several user roles with varying levels of access and permissions. Please check [Pressbooks Guide](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/pressbooks/chapter/provide-access-to-others/) for details. However, for the sake of simplicity and seamless collaboration, this guide recommends assigning the Administrator role to all other student developers. This ensures that each user has full access to the book's content and settings, reducing potential roadblocks and allowing for a smoother, more efficient workflow.

1. Click 'Users' tab on the left menu
   ![Users link and Add Exising User button are highlighted](/pressbooks-getting-started-student/add_user_1.png)
2. Click 'Add Existing User' button
   ![Add new user link, role selection, and add existing user button are highlighted](/pressbooks-getting-started-student/add_user_2.png)
3. Enter the email address and select role (Administrator can view and make changes on your book)
4. Click 'Add Existing User' button!

   \*Note: all Centennial College user accounts should be associated with my.centennialcollege.com email addresses. If a user sends you an add request that is not a myCentennial account, request that they create a new account by [Log In to Your Account for Pressbooks](#log-in-to-your-account-for-pressbooks) using the SSO page outlined in the login instructions above.

## CSS Styles

When customizing your **Pressbooks** project, applying custom CSS styles lets you tailor the look and feel of your content for both web and PDF formats—separately. **Pressbooks** allows you to add your own CSS through the “Appearance” > “Custom Styles” section, where you can target styles specifically for the webbook and for PDF (print and digital print) formats individually. This flexibility means you can create a visually engaging online version while keeping the print/PDF version clean and professional. Whether you're adjusting fonts, spacing, or layout elements, custom CSS gives you full control over your book’s presentation across different formats. The following steps explains in detail how to apply custom styles separately for both the web and PDF formats.

### Apply custom-CSS styles for Web

1. Hover your mouse to the 'Apperance' button on left side
2. Click 'custom styles'
   ![custom styles link is highlighted](/pressbooks-getting-started-student/custom_css_1.png)
3. The CSS styles in the Theme Web Styles (Malala) section are the default styles provided by the Malala theme. The CSS styles in the Your Web Styles section are custom styles you can create for the web
   ![The “Custom Styles” tab is selected and 'Web' is selected](/pressbooks-getting-started-student/custom_css_2.png)
4. Click 'Save' button!

### Apply custom-css styles for PDF

## Set Up and Enable H5P Content

H5P content brings interactive, engaging elements to your **Pressbooks** projects, transforming static text into dynamic learning experiences. With H5P, you can embed quizzes, interactive videos, drag-and-drop activities, flashcards, and more—right within your chapters. What makes H5P unique in **Pressbooks** is its seamless integration: content can be added directly into the body of your book, making it ideal for open educational resources (OER) and digital textbooks. By including H5P, you not only enhance student engagement but also support active learning across different formats and devices. The following steps explains how to create, enable, and insert H5P activities into **Pressbooks**.

### Create a New H5P Content

Technically, you don’t need an eCampus H5P account to create H5P activities in Pressbooks—you can create them directly by selecting ‘Add New’ under the H5P Content menu. However, having an eCampus H5P account is highly recommended, as it makes the process easier and more convenient. With an account, you can easily manage your created activities from your dashboard and explore a wide range of H5P content shared by others, complete with appropriate copyright information.
